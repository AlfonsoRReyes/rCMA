demoCMA1  	     optimize the unconstrained sphere task
demoCMA2  	     optimize the unconstrained sphere task and the task TR2 (sphere with linear constraint)
demoEvalMeanX    just to show the full code of function cmaEvalMeanX
demoRJavaTR2     same as the TR2 task of demoCMA2, but w/o using rCMA functions, only functions from the underlying rJava package
