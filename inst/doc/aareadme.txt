Editing the .html file(s) in this dir: 
	- Write / edit it as plain HTML text file with the help of SELFHTML (http://de.selfhtml.org).
	- Only then we reach full W3C conformance when checking HTML with W3C validator (http://validator.w3.org/) as it is required by Email Kurt Hornik 27.07.2014.
	- index.html was generated from the MS-Word-saved .html file by 
		- adding the first line: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
		- simply removing all informations in <head>...</head>, besides the mandatory <title>Index TDMR</title>
		- replacing <o:p></o:p> by nothing
		- replacing <ul type=disc> by <ul>
		- replacing <u> ... </u> (underline) by <strong> ... </strong>.
